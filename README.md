This C++ program prompts the user to input their total credit hours earned and determines their academic classification based on the input. The program categorizes the user into one of the following classifications:

Freshman: 1–15 credit hours
Sophomore: 16–45 credit hours
Junior: 46–75 credit hours
Senior: 76 or more credit hours
If the input is outside the valid range, an error message ("Invalid input") is displayed. The program uses if and else if statements to evaluate the number of credit hours and display the appropriate classification.
